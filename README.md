# Weather-Analysis-Using-Image-Recognition

## Project Name: Weather-Analysis-Using-Image-Recognition
### Description:
Many industries have the need to identify current and past weather conditions. The data helps them plan, organize, and/or optimize their operations. Using CNNs offer the potential to automate this by providing a digital eye. If an image recognition model could be built to identify conditions by looking at images of the weather, it could be deployed to automatically trigger smart devices.

### Technologies Used:
Python 3 <br />
TensorFlow <br />
Keras   
pandas  <br />
NumPy   <br />
Sklearn
